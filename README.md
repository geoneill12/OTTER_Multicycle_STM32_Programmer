# OTTER_Multicycle_STM32_Programmer

This project was motivated by the tediousness of having to re-synthesize an entire hardware design in Vivado everytime I wanted to load a new program onto the OTTER. This can sometimes take 10-15 minutes depending on the design, and makes software testing extremely slow.
